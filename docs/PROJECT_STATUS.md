## 4. Known Issues, Risks & Mitigation

### Active Technical Risks
1. **Inventory Concurrency Under Peak Ordering:** Simultaneous checkout by salesmen for scarce stock could lead to over-allocation if database locking is flawed.
   - *Mitigation:* Explicit row locking (`SELECT FOR UPDATE`) and dedicated concurrency automated test suite (`QA-005`).
2. **Order Adjustment Complexity:** Post-order quantity modifications affect allocations, inventory reservations, taxes, and customer outstanding balances simultaneously.
   - *Mitigation:* Isolated `order_adjustments` domain using atomic database transactions (`DB::transaction`) and non-destructive quantity tracking (`RULE-ALLOC-001`).
3. **Payment Evidence Security Leakage:** Cheque and money-order JPEG photos contain sensitive financial data.
   - *Mitigation:* Private Amazon S3 bucket with zero public access; short-lived presigned URLs ($\le 15\text{ mins}$) generated on-demand for authorized roles only (`RULE-FILE-003`).
4. **Historical Financial Mutability:** Future changes to product prices or taxes could corrupt past invoices or journal entries.
   - *Mitigation:* Dual-layer immutability via PostgreSQL triggers and Eloquent event guards, plus complete customer/company/line snapshots recorded at generation time (`RULE-PRI-001`, `RULE-TAX-002`, `RULE-DOC-003`).

## 5. Open Decisions & TBD Items

The following business items are marked **TBD** in specifications and must be resolved by client confirmation or defaulted using safe, configurable settings:

- **DEC-TBD-001:** Exact sales tax jurisdiction rules and exemption certificate handling (PRD §11.7). Default: single configurable percentage rate per tax profile.
- **DEC-TBD-002:** Tax rounding policy. Default: Banker's rounding (`ROUND_HALF_UP`) to 2 decimal places per line item.
- **DEC-TBD-003:** Exact cheque return/bounce administrative fee policy. Default: restore receivable without automated fee.
- **DEC-TBD-004:** Exact Money Order verification and shift reconciliation workflow (PRD §19.6). Default: manual verification by Admin/Accountant.
- **DEC-TBD-005:** Whether unverified pending cheque payments reduce customer credit exposure immediately or upon verification. Default: exposure reduced only upon verification (`VERIFIED`).
- **DEC-TBD-006:** Default policy for customer balances after downward adjustment: automated account credit vs cash refund. Default: account credit balance created.
- **DEC-TBD-007:** Exact revenue recognition timing: upon dispatch vs upon delivery. Default: recognized upon delivery confirmation.
- **DEC-TBD-008:** Invoice sequential numbering format and prefix. Resolved: `INV-{YYYY}-{000001}` via PostgreSQL sequence `invoice_number_seq`.

- **Staging Environment:** Not configured (`DEPLOY-001` scheduled for Phase 11).
- **Production AWS Environment:** Architecture-ready (`DEPLOY-002` scheduled for Phase 11).
